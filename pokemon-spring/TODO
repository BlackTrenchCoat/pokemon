Update Hibernate version?

I tried 4.2.5.Final:

    Error creating bean with name 
    'org.springframework.dao.annotation.PersistenceExceptionTranslationPostProcessor#0' 
    defined in class path resource [META-INF/spring/applicationContext.xml]: Initialization 
    of bean failed; nested exception is java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Lorg/hibernate/cache/CacheProvider;
    
    See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/578433/how-to-solve-lazy-initialization-exception-using-jpa-and-hibernate-as-provider

	There's some general discussion of upgrading from Hibernate 3.x to Hibernate 4.x at 
	http://spring.io/blog/2012/04/06/migrating-to-spring-3-1-and-hibernate-4-1/.

Look into Hibernate console

Is damage calculation output too low?

Q: Accuracy and evasion - In Pokedex 2012, POKEMON_STATS does not have values for accuracy and evasion.  
   STATS.IS_BATTLE_ONLY is set to true for these two stats.
   So where do these 'battle only' values come from?
A: There's some discussion of this at http://faqs.neoseeker.com/Games/GBC/pokemon_ab.txt.
   (Text search to [M05] Accuracy and Evade).
   Accuracy and Evade of a Pokemon function like the stats, except Accuracy and Evade are initialized 
   to zero at the beginning of a battle, where the other stats are initialized to values from the Pokedex.
   So, there's probably no need to persist accuracy and evasion in the Pokemon database.

Q: Replace conditional with polymorphism in the big switch statement in Pokemon.doMove()?
A: I think I'll hold off on this for a while, at least until most of the moves are defined.
   This would work best if a move could be reduced to a neat modular definition, but many
   moves have complex effects that span multiple turns.

Add sex to Pokemon schema and entity and use gender appropriate pronouns

What to do if two Pokemon battle and they both exhaust the PP of all their moves?
