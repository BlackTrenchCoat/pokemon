This is my Spring and Hibernate playground.
It's very much a work in progress.
Some day, it's going to be an awesome Pokemon application, but it's nowhere near finished.

See https://github.com/veekun/pokedex/wiki/Getting-Data for instructions to load the database.
You'll also need to create an empty Pokemon database; see src/main/resources/sql.

There are 2 main programs:

InitializePopulation: Populate a database of randomly generated Pokemon, and their moves.

Fight: Choose 2 Pokemon out of the above database and have them duel.

What I eventually have in mind is a sort of Pokemon survival of the fittest arena, where
I can create a large population of Pokemon and have them battle each other until a 
supreme survivor claws his way to the top of a heap of fainted Pokemon.
