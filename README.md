pokemon
=======

Two Pokemon-related Spring and Hibernate projects based on
Alex Munro's Pokedex database (See https://github.com/veekun/pokedex).

These are spare-time projects from 2012 and 2013 which in a lot of ways
don't represent modern best practices.

Both were originally configured with a combination of annotations and
XML.  In 2016 I rewrote SpringWebFlowBrowsePokemon to use Java
configuration.

Both of these projects use ancient Hibernate 3 and employ Hibernate
Tools database reverse engineering relying on a DBRE Maven plugin.
